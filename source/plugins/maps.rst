Plugin usage
============

When the plugin is installed, a group `Maps` is added to Galette menu when a member is logged in, which contains `My location` entry. This page allow member to store its location.

A `Geolocalize` button is also added when displaying a member, that allows administrators to set member coordinates.

Also, a `Map` entry is added in public pages list, that displays geolocalized members that are up to date. Administrators and staff members will see all members, while simple members and visitors will only see up to date public ones.

First of all, members will enter their location coordinates. Several options are provided:

* if town has been set in member information, a list of possible places will be proposed (via `Nominatim online service <https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org>`_),
* additionnaly, a search zone (provided from `OpenStreetMap <https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/>`_),
* and also a geolocalize button using browser capacities.

The search zone can be used when saving members location, and when displaying the maps.

A member can define its location (with the precision he wants) on the map selecting one of the propositions:

Using the geolocalization button will define its position from the browser:
