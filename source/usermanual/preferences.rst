   :align: center
   :alt: Galette settings, e-mail tab

* **Sender name**: name of the sender,

* **Activate HTML editor**: activate HTML format when sending emails (discouraged),
* **Emailing method**: method used to send emails:

  * **Emailing disabled**: no email will be send from Galette,
  * **PHP mail function**: uses the PHP ``mail()`` fonctions and related parameters (recommended when possible),
  * **Using a SMTP server**: uses an external SMTP server to configure (will be slower than PHP ``mail()`` function),
  * **Using GMail as SMTP**: same as SMTP server, but GMail specific (will also be slower than PHP ``mail()`` function),
  * **Using sendmail server**: uses local server sendmail,
  * **Using qmail server**: uses local server qmail,

* **Mail signature**: signature added to all sent emails. Available variables are displayed in the inline help from the application.

When using GMail as SMTP, you will have to configure user name and password to use.

SMTP configuration is a bit more complexe :

* **SMTP server**: server address, required,
* **SMTP port**: server port, required,
* **Use SMTP authentication**: if your server requires an authentication. In this case, you will also have to set username and password,
* **Use TLS for SMTP**: enable SSL support (always on for GMail),
* **Allow unsecure TLS**: on some cases, SSL certificate may be invalid (self signed for example).

The `Test mail settings` button will send a test message to the email currently stored as members administrator.

Security
========

.. versionadded:: 0.9.4

.. warning::

   Complex password rules are not user friendly; but security is mainly never :)

   Of course, all passwords should be as secure as possible, but this is especially true for all accounts that have privileges (staff, admin, super-admin); you may explain your users why this is important.

You can enforce some rules for members (and super-admin) passwords:

* minimum length (6 characters or more),
* minimum "strength",
* blacklist,
* no personal information.

.. image:: ../_styles/static/images/usermanual/prefs_security.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center
   :alt: Galette settings, security tab

Length is still the only rule that is active per default, just configure the number of characters required. On passwords fields, failures will be displayed on the fly; as well as a "strength meter" displayed for information.

.. note::

   If you enable password checks, it is not possible to know if some of existing ones does not respect them. Galette will display a warning at login if checks are not respected, but login will still be possible!

But wait... Password security is important, but Galette does not enforce nothing! Isn't that dumb? Well, not really. For tests or entirely private instances, security may be less important; and in some cases, being too restrictive may be an issue for your users; that's why this is up to you to secure as needed; just like using SSL or not :)

Password strength
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Password strength calculation is quite simple. It is based on 4 rules:

* contains lower case characters,
* contains upper case characters,
* contains number,
* contains special characters.

You can choose between 5 values for strength configuration:

* **none**: (default): disables strength checks and check for personal information,
* **weaker**: enables check for personal information, only one of the rule is mandatory,
* **medium**: two rules are mandatory,
* **strong**: three rules are mandatory,
* **very strong**: the four rules are mandatory.

Blacklisted passwords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A default list of 500 common passwords is provided as a blacklist you can enable, "galette" is also blacklisted.

.. note::

   The ``galette/data/blacklist.txt`` file is used to list blacklisted terms (one per line). You can provide your own file, we advice you to complete the existing one.

Personal information as password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This check rely on strength activation (all but **none** level). For the super-admin account, this will just ensure you are not using login as password. For standard accounts, there are several information involved:

* name,
* surname,
* nickname,
* login,
* email,
* birthdate,
* town

Basically, user cannot use verbatim any of those information as password. Some possible combinations are also checked, like surname and name couple (or name and surname), first letter of surname with name, etc. Birthdate will be checked in different formats as well (localized, international, and some variants).

Admin
=====

.. note::

   This tab wil be present only if you are logged in as super administrator.
